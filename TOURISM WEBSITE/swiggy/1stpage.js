Though the forest cover in India is only at about 22%, the subcontinent is home to about 10% of the world’s species. The country’s first national park (now known as Jim Corbett National Park) was created in 1936. Up until 1970, there were only five national parks of India. But in 1971, much to everyone’s shock, it was discovered that there were only about 1,800 wild Tigers left in India. Within two years, both the Wildlife Protection Act and Project Tiger were created, which has led to a substantial increase in India’s tiger population. Today, there are 103 national parks and 50 tiger reserves in India.
